# Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API client

The Pdfcrowd API lets you easily create PDF from web pages or raw HTML
code in your Python 3 applications.

To use the API, you need Python3 and an account on
[http://pdfcrowd.com](https://pdfcrowd.com), if you don't have one you
can sign up [here](https://pdfcrowd.com/pricing/api/). This will give
you a username and an API key.

## Installation

The package can be retrieved from
[pypi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfcrowd/). You can install it with pip/easy_install:

    pip install pdfcrowd
    
Or you can download/clone the client and run

    git clone git@github.com:pdfcrowd/pdfcrowd-python.git    
    cd pdfcrowd-python/
    python setup.py install

## Example

(don't forget to use your `"username"` and `"apikey"`)

    import pdfcrowd
    
    try:
        # create an API client instance
        client = pdfcrowd.Client("username", "apikey")
    
        # convert a web page and store the generated PDF into a pdf variable
        pdf = client.convertURI('http://example.com')
    
        # convert an HTML string and save the result to a file
        html="<html><body>In-memory HTML.</body></html>"
        client.convertHtml(html, open('html.pdf', 'wb'))
    
        # convert an HTML file
        client.convertFile('/path/to/local/file.html', open('file.pdf', 'wb'))
    
    except pdfcrowd.Error as why:
        print('Failed: {}'.format(why))
